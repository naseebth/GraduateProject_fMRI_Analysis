This projec consists of a computational technique built on MATLAB and python, that reads the fMRI data, 
computes two state markov chain according to the characterstics of the data, and, calculates transition
probabilities, and expands it to n -> ထ , so that we would be able to understand the data's asymptotic behavior, 
and built a stable privacy-preserving model. The machine learning predictive models are then used to validate how the our proposed model performs.

## Technologies
  * Matlab
  * Python
  * Numpy v1.8.2
  * Pandas v0.25.1

## Data Source
The data is obtained from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-81/www/ , which showcases the work done by professionals of CMU in this sector.


## Goals
   * Understand the fMRI data and analyze its scope.
   * To learn the technical specifications required to build a new predictive model.
   * To protect the privacy of fMRI data whilst maintaining it's privacy accuracy
   * To hone research skills, and investivate compressed sensing and compressed learning concepts.
